### Pilot 1.3 (LATEST)

- 2 effort levels (effort levels coded 0, 1)
  - dots [coherence]: 10 [0.05], 500 [0.05]
  - dot size: 3
  - coherent dots' display duration: 3 frames
  - dot speed: 0.01
  - field size: 1
- RT deadline is 3s
- false rewards

Task procedure

* Practice easy trials (80% coherence) (introduce task difficulty cues)
  * 2 difficulty levels (10, 500 dots), 5 trials each
* PHASE 1
  * Practice actual trials with false feedback (90% accuracy for easy task, 45% accuracy for difficult task)
  * Actual forced choice (no false feedback provided)
    * 2 difficulty levels (10, 500 dots), 5 trials each
  * Practice demand selection (no false feedback provided)
    * 5 trials
  * Actual demand selection (no false feedback provided)
    * 20 trials
* PHASE 2
  * Practice demand selection (reward performance): 10 trials
  * Practice demand selection (reward choice): 10 trials
  * Practice demand selection (no reward): 5 trials
  * Block 1: Actual demand selection training (neutral block): 60 trials
  * Blocks 2 and 3 (counterbalanced)
    * Actual demand selection training (choice block): 60 trials
    * Actual demand selection training (performance block): 60 trials
* Task perceptions and debrief

### Pilot 1.2 

* 2 effort levels (effort levels coded 0, 1)
  * dots [coherence]: 10 [0.05], 500 [0.05]
  * coherent dots' display duration: 3 frames
* false feedback (0 or 1 point for wrong and correct responses) provided after every trial
  * probability of receiving points (i.e., getting "correct") on effort level 0 and 1 are 90% and 45% respectively
* RT deadline is 3s

### Pilot 1.1

#### Task parameters

- 4 effort levels (effort levels coded 0, 1, 2, 3)
  - dots [coherence]: 10 [0.05], 50 [0.06], 250 [0.07], 500 [0.08]
  - coherent dots' display duration: 3 frames
- feedback (correct/wrong) provided after every trial
- RT deadline is 4 s
- all trials are presented in random order

#### Task flow

- practice forced choice
  - 1 rep per effort level (coherent dots are shown for 12 frames/200 ms) (really easy practice rounds!)
  - 3 reps per effort level (coherent dots are shown for 3 frames/50 ms) (actual trials)
- forced choice block
  - 10 reps per effort level; confidence and effort ratings after each trial (1-9 point scale), before task feedback
- practice demand selection task
  - 1 rep each: 0 vs 1, 0 vs 2, 1 vs 2
- actual demand selection task
  - 6 combinations: 0 vs 1, 0 vs 2, 0 vs 3, 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 2 vs 3
  - 10 reps per combination 

### Pilot 1 Task flow

* practice dot motion tasks: 3 easy dot motion trials with 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 coherence and 10, 100, 500 dots respectively (rate confidence and effort required after each trial; 9-point scale)
* actual dot motion tasks (to get confidence and effort ratings for each effort level): 3 effort levels with 10, 100, 500 dots (all 0.05 motion coherence; 5 reps each, so 15 trials in total) (confidence/effort rating after each trial)
* practice demand selection task (not collecting confidence/effort ratings)
* actual demand selection task: efforts 1vs2, 1vs3, 2vs3 (10 trials each) (not collecting confidence/effort ratings)
* belief of task feedback rating (once at the end of the experiment)
* RT deadline is 3s

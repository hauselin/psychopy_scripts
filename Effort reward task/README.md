## Pilot 1 Task flow

* practice dot motion tasks: 3 easy dot motion trials with 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 coherence and 10, 100, 500 dots respectively (rate confidence and effort required after each trial; 9-point scale)
* actual dot motion tasks (to get confidence and effort ratings for each effort level): 3 effort levels with 10, 100, 500 dots (all 0.05 motion coherence; 5 reps each, so 15 trials in total) (confidence/effort rating after each trial)
* practice demand selection task (not collecting confidence/effort ratings)
* actual demand selection task: efforts 1vs2, 1vs3, 2vs3 (10 trials each) (not collecting confidence/effort ratings)
* belief of task feedback rating (once at the end of the experiment)
* RT deadline is 3s

Tested in PsychoPy 1.90.2 (MacOS)
